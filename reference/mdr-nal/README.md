# Metadata Registry - Named Authority Lists

This folder contains RDF representations of some of the [Named Authority Lists](http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/authority/index.html) from the EU's Metadata Registry, which are used as codelists for DCAT-AP.

They're included here because the URIs used in the NALs are sadly not dereferenceable, so they're hard to look up without searching for them first. Also, the original versions are in RDF/XML, while they are included here as Turtle.

The common prefix is: `http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/`

| URI prefix | Filename | Web source |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------- |
| `language/`  | [`languages-skos-ap-act.ttl`](languages-skos-ap-act.ttl) | [Language](http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/authority/language/index.html) |
| `data-theme/` | [`data-theme-skos-ap-act.ttl`](data-theme-skos-ap-act.ttl) | [Publication Theme](http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/authority/data-theme/index.html) |
