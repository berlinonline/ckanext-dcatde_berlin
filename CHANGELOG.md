# Changelog

## Development

- Change modelling of HVD-categorisation to DCAT-AP.de 3.0:
  - Instead of using `dct:references`, use `dcatap:hvdCategory`.
  - Use `dcatap:applicableLegislation <http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2023/138/oj>`.

## [0.3.9](https://github.com/berlinonline/ckanext-dcatde_berlin/releases/tag/0.3.9)

_(2025-05-07)_

- While at this stage we should expect good license codes, be more lenient in what we accept and hand√∂e. In case we get one which is not in our standard list of codes, we should still give useful output in the DCAT-output.

## [0.3.8](https://github.com/berlinonline/ckanext-dcatde_berlin/releases/tag/0.3.8)

_(2025-03-28)_

- WFS and WMS resources are now output as a `dcat:DataService` and matching service distribution. See https://www.dcat-ap.de/def/dcatde/2.0/implRules/#modellierung-eines-datenservices.
- Ensure that there is always a maximum of one `locn:geometry` per `dct:Location`. It should be the one with datatype `gsp:wktLiteral`.
- Unit tests that check RDF output are now based on parsing with rdflib, rather than just looking for strings (which is brittle, because representations can differ).
- Use `euro_dcat_ap_2` as the base profile.
- Announce that we're outputting DCAT-AP.de 2.0.
- Check for presence of special tags/keywords with the pattern `HVD_{ID}` and add corresponding `dct:references` statements to output. This is to support the setting of high-value dataset categories for external data sources systems (e.g. harvested portals and Imperia) that do not (yet) have a mechanism for setting HVD catgories.

## [0.3.7](https://github.com/berlinonline/ckanext-dcatde_berlin/releases/tag/0.3.7)

_(2025-03-28)_

- Expose Musterdatensatz (sample record) with `dct:references` (see https://www.dcat-ap.de/def/dcatde/2.0/implRules/#verweis-auf-referenzobjekte).

## [0.3.6](https://github.com/berlinonline/ckanext-dcatde_berlin/releases/tag/0.3.6)

_(2025-03-27)_

- Expose HVD (high-value dataset) category with `dct:references` (see https://www.dcat-ap.de/def/dcatde/2.0/implRules/#verweis-auf-referenzobjekte).
- Fix license key for CC BY 4.0 in [licenses.json](ckanext/dcatde_berlin/mappings/licenses.json).

## [0.3.5](https://github.com/berlinonline/ckanext-dcatde_berlin/releases/tag/0.3.5)

_(2024-12-20)_

- Update config settings (read from .ini file or use default value if the variable is not set).
- Add OpenCode [publiccode.yml](publiccode.yml) file.
- Update README.

## [0.3.4](https://github.com/berlinonline/ckanext-dcatde_berlin/releases/tag/0.3.4)

_(2023-05-19)_

- Fix packaging to ensure VERSION file and mapping JSON files are included in built distributions.

## [0.3.3](https://github.com/berlinonline/ckanext-dcatde_berlin/releases/tag/0.3.3)

_(2023-05-11)_

- Set `ckanext.dcatde_berlin.additional_endpoints` in code, derived from the `catalog_no_fb` endpoint's blueprint.
- Fix bug where unknown groups/categories would lead to a key error.
- Define extension's version string in [VERSION](VERSION), make available as `ckanext.dcatde_berlin.__version__` and in [setup.py](setup.py).

## [0.3.2](https://github.com/berlinonline/ckanext-dcatde_berlin/releases/tag/0.3.2)

_(2023-01-25)_

- Fix changelog.
- Fix manifest.

## [0.3.1](https://github.com/berlinonline/ckanext-dcatde_berlin/releases/tag/0.3.1)

_(2022-10-25)_

- Change codecov upload in github CI, now using the recommended approach as defined in https://docs.codecov.com/docs#step-4-upload-coverage-reports-to-codecov

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/berlinonline/ckanext-dcatde_berlin/releases/tag/0.3.0)

_(2022-10-21)_

- Convert to Python 3.
- Replace IRoutes interface with IBlueprint.
- Add tests.
- Switch from RST to Markdown for Readme.
- Reformat changelog, add dates and version links.

## [0.2.1](https://github.com/berlinonline/ckanext-dcatde_berlin/releases/tag/v0.2.1)

_(2020-07-29)_

- Add a second DCAT `catalog` endpoint which returns only those datasets that were _not_ harveseted from FIS-Broker. URL is `/catalog_no_fb.{FORMAT}` (the regular endpoint is `/catalog.{FORMAT}`).
- Remove `ckanext-dcat` from `requirements.txt`, as this can cause conflicts with a manually installed version of the same library.

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/berlinonline/ckanext-dcatde_berlin/releases/tag/v0.2.0)

_(2019-12-13)_

- Add changelog.
- Remove `dct:publisher` statements based on the CKAN organization, as that is only used internally to control access rights. There are organizations like "Simplesearch" or "FIS-Broker Harvester" that don't make sense as a publisher.
- Add information from `berlin_source` field as [dct:accrualMethod](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/2012-06-14/?v=terms#terms-accrualMethod).

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/berlinonline/ckanext-dcatde_berlin/releases/tag/v0.1.0)
